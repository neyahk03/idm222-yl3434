                    <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong> Pete's Little Lunch Box food truck, which offers a variety of quick meals and snacks, faced long wait times and inefficient order management during rush hour. This caused frustration for students and staff who had limited time between classes. The goal of the research was to understand the pain points, motivations, and preferences of Pete's customers, allowing us to design an app that aligned with their needs and enhanced their ordering experience.</p>

        <h3>Context and Problem Definition</h3>

        <p>Pete's Little Lunch Box food truck located on Drexel's campus serves a large volume of students during peak hours, leading to long queues and wait times. As a result, many students find it inconvenient to order food between classes, impacting their ability to make the most of short breaks. The main challenges were to eliminate the inefficiencies in the ordering process and create a solution that fits the fast-paced environment of a campus.</p>


        <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Drexel students, staff, and visitors on campus.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer wait during peak hours</li>
                <li>Inconvenience for students with limited time between classes</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>

        <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong>  I did surveys and interviews with Drexel students to understand the pain points. I also observed peak hours and customer interactions to gather insights on the current order process.</p>

        <strong>Key Findings:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal connection:</strong> Customers valued the personal connection with the staff. Being remembered and recognized by the staff made customers feel prioritized and created a sense of belonging, especially for students who are away from their hometowns.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Quick service and familiarity:</strong> The speed of service was a highlight for customers, with the wait time generally being short. Additionally, the consistent quality of food and friendly interactions with staff kept customers returning.</li>
            <li><strong>Convenience in ordering:</strong> Some customers preferred the option to call and order ahead to save time, especially during busy periods. Having multiple ordering options (in-person and phone) was appreciated.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>User Personas:</strong>
