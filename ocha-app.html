        <h3>Research and Strategy</h3>

        <strong>Understanding the User</strong>

        <p>The goal of the research phase was to gain a deeper understanding of the Weee! app users, their goals, and their pain points to create an improved experience. I aimed to use this knowledge to create a cohesive user persona and inform the design process.</p>

        </div>

        <strong>Brainstorming the User's Story</strong>

        <p>To better understand Jasmine's needs and how the Weee! app fits into her daily routine, I brainstormed a story around her experience using Big Idea worksheet. This helped in identifying touchpoints where the app could make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <img src="images/weee/big-idea-worksheet.png" alt="Big Idea Worksheet">
        </div>

        <strong>Conducting Surveys and Interviews</strong>

        <p>After establishing the persona and story, I conducted surveys and interviews with real users to validate Jasmine's story and gather additional insights. The research focused on understanding users' expectations, pain points, and motivations. </p>

        <strong>Key Findings:</strong>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frequency and Convenience:</strong> A majority of participants use grocery delivery apps for convenience and time-saving benefits. They often shop multiple times a week or weekly, using services like Weee! to streamline grocery shopping around their busy schedules.</li>

            <li><strong>Convenience and Time-Saving:</strong> College students, including those with tight schedules, emphasized the convenience of delivery over in-store shopping, especially due to Weee!'s ability to save time and effort.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Product Selection:</strong> Users primarily buy snacks, beverages, and culturally relevant foods through these apps.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Journey Mapping and Storytelling</h3>

        <strong>Creating a User Journap Map</strong>

        <p>I used the insights from surveys and interviews to create a journey map for Jasmine. The journey map outlined Jasmine's interactions with the Weee! app, from browsing products to placing an order and tracking delivery.</p>

        <!-- <h3>Context and Problem Definition</h3>

        <p>Pete's Little Lunch Box food truck located on Drexel's campus serves a large volume of students during peak hours, leading to long queues and wait times. As a result, many students find it inconvenient to order food between classes, impacting their ability to make the most of short breaks. The main challenges were to eliminate the inefficiencies in the ordering process and create a solution that fits the fast-paced environment of a campus.</p>


        <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Drexel students, staff, and visitors on campus.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer wait during peak hours</li>
                <li>Inconvenience for students with limited time between classes</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>Research and Insights</h3>

        <p><strong>Research Approach:</strong>  I did surveys and interviews with Drexel students to understand the pain points. I also observed peak hours and customer interactions to gather insights on the current order process.</p>

        <strong>Key Findings:</strong> 
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal connection:</strong> Customers valued the personal connection with the staff. Being remembered and recognized by the staff made customers feel prioritized and created a sense of belonging, especially for students who are away from their hometowns.

            </li>
            <li><strong>Quick service and familiarity:</strong> The speed of service was a highlight for customers, with the wait time generally being short. Additionally, the consistent quality of food and friendly interactions with staff kept customers returning.</li>
            <li><strong>Convenience in ordering:</strong> Some customers preferred the option to call and order ahead to save time, especially during busy periods. Having multiple ordering options (in-person and phone) was appreciated.</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>User Personas:</strong>
