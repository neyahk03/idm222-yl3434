        <h3>Research and Strategy</h3>

        <strong>Understanding the User</strong>

        <p>The goal of the research phase was to gain a deeper understanding of the Weee! app users, their goals, and their pain points to create an improved experience. I aimed to use this knowledge to create a cohesive user persona and inform the design process.</p>

            <img src="images/weee/Jasmine-persona.png" alt="User Persona">
        </div>

        <strong>Brainstorming the User's Story</strong>

        <p>To better understand Jasmine's needs and how the Weee! app fits into her daily routine, I brainstormed a story around her experience using Big Idea worksheet. This helped in identifying touchpoints where the app could make a meaningful impact.</p>

            <img src="images/weee/big-idea-worksheet.png" alt="Big Idea Worksheet">
        </div>

        <strong>Conducting Surveys and Interviews</strong>

        <p>After establishing the persona and story, I conducted surveys and interviews with real users to validate Jasmine's story and gather additional insights. The research focused on understanding users' expectations, pain points, and motivations. </p>

        <strong>Key Findings:</strong>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Frequency and Convenience:</strong> A majority of participants use grocery delivery apps for convenience and time-saving benefits. They often shop multiple times a week or weekly, using services like Weee! to streamline grocery shopping around their busy schedules.</li>

            <li><strong>Convenience and Time-Saving:</strong> College students, including those with tight schedules, emphasized the convenience of delivery over in-store shopping, especially due to Weee!'s ability to save time and effort.
            </li>

            <li><strong>Product Selection:</strong> Users primarily buy snacks, beverages, and culturally relevant foods through these apps.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Journey Mapping and Storytelling</h3>

        <strong>Creating a User Journap Map</strong>

        <p>I used the insights from surveys and interviews to create a journey map for Jasmine. The journey map outlined Jasmine's interactions with the Weee! app, from browsing products to placing an order and tracking delivery.</p>

        <strong>Turning Journey Map to Storyboard</strong>

        </div>

        <strong>Storyboard Testing</strong>
        <p>After creating the storyboard, I conducted storyboard testing with 3 people to validate my story</p>

            <li>Users related to Jasmine's struggles with grocery shopping, especially her lack of time and transportation challenges.</li>
            <li>Many felt happy for Jasmine when she found a convenient solution with the app.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <strong>Convenience and Relatability</strong>
            <li>Users found the app appealing for its convenience, particularly for people with busy schedules or limited access to transportation.</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>
            <strong>Suggestions for Improvement</strong>
            <li>Price transparency was important to users, who suggested including a price comparison or breakdown (e.g., delivery and service fees) in the story.</li>
            <li>Users felt this addition would make the story more realistic, reflecting real-life considerations when deciding to use a delivery service.</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
