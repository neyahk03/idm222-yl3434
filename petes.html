                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    <p>This project is part of the User Experience course taught by Professor Chris Nappi. It involved designing a take-out app for Pete's Little Lunch Box, a popular food truck near Drexel University. Known for its quick, customizable meals but lacking branding, Pete's was an ideal candidate for a digital makeover. Through collaborative efforts, our team utilized user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing to create an app that reflected Pete's charm and practicality while addressing user needs and aligning with its values.</p>

        <h3>Challenge</h3>

        <strong>Who is Pete's?</strong>

        <p>Pete's is an American style breakfast and lunch food truck located on Drexel University's campus. They provide hearty and efficient meals at a low cost for students and workers in the area. Pete's meals fill up both stomachs and hearts.</p>

        <p>We chose Pete's Little Lunch Box for its strong community presence and charm, aiming to translate this into a mobile app. Despite a small menu, their customizable options created a deceptively long list, challenging us to simplify it without overwhelming users. Additionally, balancing our team's workload and schedules proved difficult, but through communication and efficient use of class time, we collaborated effectively to deliver a comprehensive app.

        <strong class="step">Empathize phase</strong>

        <p>To kickstart the project, we initiated a Fly on the Wall exercise, where each team member observed customers interacting with the food truck at different times of the day. In addition, we conducted interviews with Pete's customers to gain deeper insights into their needs and pain points. </p>

        <section class="insight">
            <strong>Key Findings:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Regular customers tend to know their orders beforehand and spend little time on the menu</li>
                <li>Non-regular customers take longer to decide and engage with the menu more</li>
                <li>While waiting, customers typically engage with phones, chat with companions, or stand quietly</li>
                <li>Payments are split between Venmo and cash, with Venmo being slightly more popula
                </li>
                <li>Busy periods align with mealtimes, particularly lunch, with a rush occurring after class hours
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- insert fly on the wall pic here -->

        <p>We also conducted a competitive analysis of four different apps—Chipotle, DoorDash, Nanu's, and Wawa—to identify the strengths and weaknesses of existing food ordering platforms and gain insights to inform our design decisions.</p>

        <strong class="step">Define phase</strong>

        <p>After getting enough insights from the customers and competitors, we define 4 user personas which represent each type of the customer and their journey.</p>

        <p>Our primary users included students from Drexel and Penn, along with local professors, faculty, and workers seeking a quick and convenient meal. These groups were identified as the most likely to consistently use the app. Additionally, we considered tourists and visiting families as part of our customer base, though their usage of the app would likely be less frequent.        </p>

        <p>Form there, we developed a visual representation of the user's journey across all the touchpoints of our application to understand where we can improve the user experience.</p>

        <strong class="step">Ideate phase</strong>

        <p>In this phase, we conducted card sorting and performed a NUF (New, Useful, and Feasible) analysis, evaluating features on a 7-point scale to prioritize and refine our design decisions.
